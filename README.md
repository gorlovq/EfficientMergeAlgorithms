## Implemented Algorithms

- **Two Way Merge Algorithm**: The traditional method for merging two sorted arrays of lengths `n` and `m`.
- **Binary Insertion for One Element**: An algorithm for inserting a single element into a sorted array using binary search to find the correct position.
- **Hwang-Lin Merging Algorithm**: A classic algorithm designed to reduce the number of comparisons during the merge process.

## Planned Implementations

- **A Simple Algorithm for Stable Minimum Storage Merging** by Pok-Son Kim and Arne Kutzner: A sophisticated algorithm focusing on minimizing storage requirements during the merge process.
- **Manacher Improved Hwang-Lin Version**: A further optimized version of the Hwang-Lin Merging Algorithm incorporating improvements by Manacher.
